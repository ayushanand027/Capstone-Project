Problem Statement: India's
first commercial airline, TATA Airlines, was founded by the business
tycoon and former TATA Group Chairman JRD Tata in 1932. The company
later went public and was renamed Air India, the country's national airline, in
1946.
The Indian government nationalised the private airline in 1953, ran it with
taxpayer money, repeatedly underwrote losses after 2007, and put the
national carrier up for sale, which had accumulated debt exceeding Rs
50,000 crore and other liabilities by then. However, the government decided
to hold on to 24% of the equity in the airline. It did not receive a single bid.
Air India was back on the strategic sale table in January 2022. The
government said it would off load 100% of its stake in the company this time.
TATA Sons clinched the deal, and after 68 years, on 27th January 2022, Air
India was welcomed back to the TATA Company.
